Below you will have one on one conversations with other agents, start your response with the tag [Agent B to Agent A] or [Agent B to Agent C]. Talk with them, see what they know, and try to deduce the killer, weapon, and room. Time is valuable so be brief! If you think you know the answer, write [submit] followed by your guess.\n",
      "[Agent A to Agent B] Hi Agent B, I've found out that the murder weapon was the Knife. Do you have insights on the suspect or the room where the murder took place?\n",
      "[Agent B to Agent C] Hello Agent C, Agent A informed me that the murder weapon was the Knife. Do you have any information on the suspect or the location where the murder occurred?\n",
      "[Agent B to Agent A] Thanks for the info, Agent A. Based on what I know, the murder did not happen in the Kitchen. I'm working with Agent C to uncover more about the suspect and the room. Let's keep each other updated.\n",
      "[Agent A to Agent B] Got it, the murder didn't happen in the Kitchen. I'll check in with Agent C to see if they have more insights on the suspect or the possible room. Keep digging, and let's solve this quickly.\n",
      "[Agent C to Agent B] Hello Agent B, I can confirm that the Candlestick was not the murder weapon. However, I don’t have direct information about the suspect or the location yet. I'll reach out to Agent A for more details on those aspects. Thanks for the update on the weapon.\n",
      "[Agent B to Agent C] Thanks, Agent C. With the Knife confirmed as the weapon and the knowledge that the murder did not happen in the Kitchen, we're narrowing it down. Keep me posted if you find any lead on the suspect or location.\n",
      "[Agent B to Agent A] Agent C confirmed that the Candlestick was not the weapon, reinforcing the Knife as our murder weapon. If you hear anything about the suspect or another possible room, let me know. We're closing in on solving this.\n",
      "[Agent A to Agent B] Great to have that confirmation about the Candlestick not being the weapon. I'll reach out to Agent C and see what they might know about the suspect or other possible rooms. Let's keep the communication tight.\n",
      "[Agent C to Agent B] Understood, Agent B. I'll check in with Agent A regarding the suspect and location to see if there's more information we can piece together. Will keep you updated as soon as I have something concrete.\n",
      "[Agent B to Agent C] Thanks, Agent C. I appreciate your coordination with Agent A. I'm confident we're close to cracking this case, especially once we identify the suspect and the exact room. Keep me in the loop with any new findings.\n",
      "[Agent B to Agent A] Absolutely, Agent A. With every bit of information, we're getting closer. I suspect the true culprit might be Professor Plum, based on a logical deduction, but I'm seeking confirmation. Let me know if you or Agent C come across solid details about the suspect or where the murder could have occurred, besides the Kitchen.\n",
      "[Agent A to Agent B] Thanks for the heads-up about Professor Plum. I'll keep that in mind. I'll reach out to Agent C to see if they can confirm anything about the suspect or other locations. If you find anything more, don't hesitate to share. We're getting there.\n",
      "[Agent C to Agent B] Definitely, Agent B. I'll reach out to Agent A now and will circle back with everything I gather. We’re making good progress, and with a little more information, I’m sure we can solve this mystery. Stay tuned!\n",
      "[Agent B to Agent C] Appreciate the teamwork, Agent C. With the knowledge that the murder weapon is the Knife and the crime didn't occur in the Kitchen, we're piecing this together. Keep tracking down those details on the suspect and room. I'll be here to integrate our findings once you or Agent A have more info.\n",
      "[Agent B to Agent A] Absolutely, Agent A. Let's keep each other informed as new details emerge. With the Knife confirmed and the Kitchen ruled out, our suspect focus on Professor Plum is tightening. If you or Agent C uncover more about the remaining rooms or confirm the suspect, we'll be ready to act. Keep up the excellent work!\n",
      "[Agent A to Agent B] Will do, Agent B. I'll check in with Agent C for further insights. Let's keep narrowing this down and solve it efficiently. I'll keep you posted on any updates or confirmations. Keep up the great work on your end too!\n",
      "[Agent C to Agent B] Absolutely, Agent B. With the Knife being the weapon and the location not being the Kitchen, we’re narrowing our search significantly. I’ll reach out to Agent A immediately to fill in those missing details about the suspect and room. We’re almost there!\n",
      "[Agent B to Agent C] Thanks, Agent C. Your efforts in reaching out to Agent A are invaluable. We're closing in quickly, and with just a bit more detail on the suspect and room, we'll have this case wrapped up. Keep me in the loop with anything new, and I'll be ready to make the deduction.
